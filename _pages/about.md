I'm a principal machine learning engineer at [Nomic](https://nomic.ai) where I lead the development of [Nomic Embed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01613), state-of-the art [text](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5) and [vision](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-vision-v1.5) embedding models.

Prior to Nomic, I worked at [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com) where I worked on machine learning for drug discovery. I worked on reimplementations of gene expression prediction from sequence ([Enformer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01252-x)) as well as helping to train [BigRNA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.29.526107v1), a model trained to predict tissue-specific RNA expression, splicing, microRNA sites, and RNA binding protein specificity from DNA sequence.

I have also participated in open-source/open-community research groups with [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/) and [OpenBioML](https://www.openbioml.org/).

In a past life, I was a Divsion 1 Baseball Player at Davidson College (yes, Steph Curry's Davidson).
